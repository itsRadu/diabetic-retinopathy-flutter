Introduction
Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye condition caused by diabetes that can lead to blindness if untreated. Early detection and classification are key to preventing vision loss. This application uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect diabetic retinopathy from retina images and is integrated with a Flutter interface.

Features
Image classification for diabetic retinopathy detection.
Model integration with TensorFlow Lite for efficient inference.
Flutter-based UI for cross-platform accessibility (Android, iOS).
Pretrained model included (.h5 and .tflite).
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle and contains retina images categorized by the severity of diabetic retinopathy. The images are resized to 224x224 pixels for training and testing.

Number of Images: [Total Image Count]
Categories: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative DR
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-retinopathy-flutter.git
cd diabetic-retinopathy-flutter
Install the necessary Flutter dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
Ensure you have Flutter and Dart SDK installed. You can check by running:

bash
Copy code
flutter doctor
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.

Model Training
The model is trained using a Jupyter notebook (DRD.ipynb) available in this repository. The training process involves:

Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization).
Building a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Training and validation on the provided dataset.
Saving the model as .h5 and converting it to .tflite for integration into the Flutter app.
To train the model:

Open the DRD.ipynb notebook.
Follow the steps for data loading, model building, and training.
Once trained, the model is saved as dr_model.h5 and dr_model.tflite.
Usage
To run the Flutter application:

Connect your device or start an emulator.
Use the following command:
bash
Copy code
flutter run
The app allows users to upload retina images and get a prediction regarding the severity of diabetic retinopathy.
